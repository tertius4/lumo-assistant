## 📋 Requirements

- VS Code `1.85.0` or higher
- A Proton account (for Lumo access)
- Internet connection

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

This extension uses Proton's Lumo API, which features:
- End-to-end encryption for all messages
- Zero-access encryption (Proton cannot read your chats)
- No data sold to third parties

Your Session ID is stored locally in VS Code's secure settings and never transmitted elsewhere.

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Code completion may take 2-5 seconds due to API latency
- Session IDs expire periodically and need to be refreshed
- Inline completion (ghost text) is not yet supported

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] Native OAuth authentication flow
- [ ] Inline code completion (ghost text)
- [ ] Multiple conversation threads
- [ ] Custom system prompts
- [ ] Streaming text display

## 👨‍💻 Development

### Development Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start TypeScript watch mode:
